# PCB_congeners
Generates full or partial lists of PCB congeners.


To get congeners with different numbers of chlorines, edit the list 'num_cl_of_interest'.

I decided to make this, which is probably of no use to anyone (a list of these congeners can easily be found), because back in 2009 my ecotoxicology lecturer asked if anyone could provide him with a clean mathematical solution for showing that there are 209 congeners of PCBs. I suppose I still can't, but I figured I could at least provide the answer using programming.
